## How to use it?
- first, you have to make sure there is a floder called "test_inputs" and executable file in same folder.

- second, put all the file you want to validate into the "test_inputs" folder, with the extension name ".txt"

## Feature

- Note that, the whitespace between the tokens is hard to deal with. I will recommend removing whitespace before using
    otherwise, it may lead a false positive result (Not a bug, but should be add in development progress.)
- You once mentioned that, in order to make it simplify, string like
```html
<person gender="female"></person>
```
Should be treated as an invalid one, I still hand out my diffcult-one version that able to deal with these attribute problem,
<person gender="female"></person> can be recognized as valid one in this version.


 - This program even able to point out which part of the XML node cause to error, for instance, the string like 
```html
<person><human><valid>this is a in valid node</invalid></human></person>
```
It will show the message enable user to know how to correct them.
```sh
Symmetry error detected: invalid should be valid
```

 - This version utilized the recursive descent approach to build a XML parser, no other dependencies in needed.
