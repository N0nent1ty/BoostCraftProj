## Feature
- You once mentioned that, in order to make it simplify, string like
```html
<person gender="female"></person>
```
Should be treated as an invalid one, I still hand out my diffcult-one version that able to deal with these attribute problem,
<person gender="female"></person> it can recognized such inputstring as a valid one in this version.


 - This program even able to point out which part of the XML node cause to error, for instance, the string like 
```html
<person><human><valid>this is a in valid node</invalid></human></person>
```
It will show the message enable user to know how to correct them.
```sh
Symmetry error detected: invalid should be valid
```

 - This version utilized the recursive descent approach to build a XML parser, no other dependencies in needed.
